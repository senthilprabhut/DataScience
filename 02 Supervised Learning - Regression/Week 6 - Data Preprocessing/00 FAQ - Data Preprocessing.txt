1. Why do we use axis=1 for calculating row mean? Shouldn't we use axis=0?
axis=0 means along the rows and axis=1 means along the columns.

So when we want to find the column means, we use axis=0 to 'move along the rows' to get the mean of the columns. When we want to find row means, we use axis=1 to 'move along the columns' to get the mean of the rows.



2. Is scaling mandatory for linear regression?
Scaling is not mandatory for linear regression but can be done to ensure that the units of the regression coefficients are the same.

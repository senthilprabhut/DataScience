FAQs - Decision Tree
1. Will Logistic Regression and Decision Tree give the same variables in order of importance?
It is not necessary that all the models give equal importance to the same variables. Each model will provide a result with different variables as important in a different order.

2. How does multicollinearity affect a Decision Tree?
Multicollinearity doesn't affect the prediction of a model rather has an impact on the interpretation we make from the model. Multicollinearity affects linear models only whereas a Decision Tree is a non-linear model that is not impacted by the presence of multicollinearity in the data.

3. Decision Tree arrows are missing, how to fix this?
Use the following code as your reference to resolve the issue and make necessary changes in name of the model, feature names, etc.

plt.figure(figsize=(20,30))
out = tree.plot_tree(model,feature_names=feature_names,filled=True,fontsize=9,node_ids=False,class_names=None,)
#below code will add arrows to the decision tree split if they are missing
for o in out:
     arrow = o.arrow_patch
     if arrow is not None:
        arrow.set_edgecolor('black')
        arrow.set_linewidth(1)
plt.show()
